# Herbs are Medicine too

Ivan's Herbs makes use of natural resources in the form of Herbs to address Health concerns. Herbs work similar to pharmaceutical medicines. Of all the approved drugs in the last 30 years, up to 50% are derived directly or indirectly from plants [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3560124/). One advantage is that negative side effects are rare. Negative side effects, if they do occur, are less severe.

We provide scientific evidence for each herbal recipe. Many of the health issues have been evaluated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is the European equivalent of the United States' Federal Drug Administration (FDA). In other cases we provide clinical and non-clinical evidence to support how herbal recipes address a specific health issue. 

Some do consider that multiple active substances in herbs may be advantageous and considered as complementary combination therapy [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3875280/). Pharmaceutical drug discovery and design based around single active molecules can be said to be 'blind' to the complex interconnected processes in a human body [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3642214/). There are academics that would say that single active molecule drug discovery is overemphasized [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3875280/). 

Herbs can be used in addition or as an alternative to pharmaceutical medicines. Herbal recipes can also be used to maintain health as a relaxant or tonic. When you are more prone to disease, such as during the winter months, herbs can be used as a preventative treatment. 

Herbs contain substances that can affect the body in a powerful way. All our herbal recipes have been stated to be safe by the European Medicine Agency when taken as indicated.
 
In most cases, but not all, herbal recipes act more slowly than pharmaceutical medicines and need to be taken for a longer time. This disadvantage is balanced by the lack of negative side effects, when herbs are taken as prescribed.
