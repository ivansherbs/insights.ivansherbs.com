Let’s get on with it.

## What is a Yeast Infection?

A yeast infection (also called candidiasis) is fungal infection on different body parts.

A trusted academic center, the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/yeast-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20378999), defines a vaginal yeast infection as:

> ...a fungal infection that causes irritation, discharge and intense itchiness of the vagina and the vulva — the tissues at the vaginal opening.

That's a pretty uncomfortable situation.

The technical term is vaginal candidiasis. It's named after the fungus, *Candida albicans*, which causes this infection most of the time.

Put another way, it's a *Candida albicans* overgrowth.

Let's see some fast home remedies that you can do to cure it.

## Yeast Infections Home Remedies

Let's look at 4 ways of how to cure yeast infections at home fast. But before I jump in, I need a disclaimer.

Do you have signs of yeast infection? Then you should call your doctor.

Run the signs of your yeast infection by them. Let them know how you plan to treat it.

Even pharmaceutical medicines don't not work every time for everyone. The same is true for home remedies.

Ok, now we are ready for the home remedies. 



**Drink Ivan Chai like a Russian**

One way to cure any type of yeast infection is with fireweed tea. Ivan Chai is the name of the traditional tea in Russia made from rolled fireweed leaves.

Where's the evidence for this? 

More than 5 scientific studies have shown the anti-fungal properties of fireweed. The [National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5045895/) has an article on these studies.

The [National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5045895/) has one article that says:

> "Extracts of *E. angustifolium* also have been shown to have bactericidal and antifungal effects"

More than 5 scientific studies support this finding.

To be a bit scientific, it's the antioxidants Quercetin and Oenothein B found in fireweed. They have a medicinal effect on fungal and yeast infections.

There's even more to this remedy. In their plant of the week post, the [U.S. Forest Service](https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/plant-of-the-week/chamerion_angustifolium.shtml#:~:text=High%20in%20vitamins%20A%20and,addition%20to%20the%20home%20garden.) has stated that fireweed is high in Vitamin C. 

So what?

It matters because [Vitamin C](anchorlink) is in itself is a remedy for yeast infections. I'll go further into that home remedy later.

Clinical herbalist Michael Cottingham has a great [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtKnuLfgXQ0) on fireweed. He explains the benefits against *Candida albicans,* and shows how to identify fireweed. 

If you'd like to our try our Ivan Chai hand-made from 100% fireweed leaves, [you're welcome to get a trial here](https://www.trial.ivansherbs.com/vaginal-yeast-infection).

*Directions*

To cure yeast infections at home, drink three full cups of Ivan Chai daily. Drink for 7 or 14 days, as needed.

It's fine to drink Ivan Chai even if you are completely healthy. In fact, Ivan Chai is safe for children.



**Get Wild with Oregano**

You don't need your typical oregano you find on your pizza. That's common oregano (*Origanum marjoram*).

You need Essential Oil of Oregano made from wild Oregano (*Origanum vulgare*).

It contains Thymol and Carvacrol. These are your trusted anti-fungals for this home remedy.

Where's the proof? 

A study from the [Journal of Applied Microbiology](https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jam.13413) investigated Essential Oil of Oregano on yeast. It showed decreased growth of our culprit *Candida albicans*.

*Directions*

To apply this home remedy, put 3-5 drops of essential oil per ounce of olive oil. Then rub the mixed oils on your skin, not your vaginal area.

I repeat, *do not apply to vaginal area*, as that causes irritation. Apply it to your skin (arms, legs, whatever) and the anti-fungals get absorbed into your body.

Another method is to use the essential oil in aromatherapy. Put a few drops in your infuser and inhale.

*Caution*

Caution for those will bleeding disorders. 

Wild oregano is a blood thinner. Don't use it at all if you have blood-clotting issues or are already taking blood thinners.

**Get high on Vitamin C**

No, you can't get on it. 

But:

Vitamin C boosts your immune system. Well known fact.

A strengthened immune system is better able to fight a yeast infection.

What else, right?

Taking Vitamin C helps regulate your blood sugar. Still wondering what's the point?

*Candida albicans* loves sugar. Reduce your sugar levels, and you'll reduce *Candida*.

There's more.

The technical name for Vitamin C is ascorbic acid. When you take it, it raises your stomach acid.

High acid levels in your stomach slows down *Candida albicans*. *Candida* hates acid.

*Directions*

You need a high dose for an effective home remedy.

To use Vitamin C as a home remedy, take up 3000 mg per day. Your body can't absorb more than that.

Here's another useful tip.

Take 1000 mg of Bioflavanoids for every 2000 mg of Vitamin C. 

It boosts the effectiveness and prolongs the effect.



**When Coconuts and Tampons become One**

Coconut oil is the fatty oil that comes from coconuts. It's a known anti-fungal.

[One study from 2016](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scientifica/2016/7061587/) showed that it's as effective as other drug solutions. The study compared it to Chlorhexidine and Ketoconazole.

It's recommended that you use pure coconut oil, and organic is better. You can tell its 100% coconut oil because it won't have a strong coconut smell to it.

*Directions*

To cure a vaginal yeast infection, you need to apply it. Apply the oil to a clean tampon and insert the tampon.

Remember to change the tampon often. 

Before using coconut oil in your vagina, you should check with your doctor.



**Test before you treat**

Again, you need to be sure you have a yeast infection. For that you need a test.

But before you go get a test, here are some signs that you have one.



## Signs of a Yeast Infection

So you are asking yourself "how do i know if I have a yeast infection?"

The following are signs of a vaginal yeast infection:

- Watery vaginal discharge
- Itching and irritation in the vagina and vulva
- Vaginal pain, soreness, and rash
- Redness and swelling of the vulva
- Thick white vaginal discharge like cottage cheese (read on for a picture)
- A burning sensation, especially during sex or while urinating

Of course, these are only signs of a yeast infection. The best way to know for sure is a test.

Read on for useful testing tips.



## Test for Yeast Infections at Home

Is it in fact a yeast infection? Most women are wrong in their diagnosis. 

A story from [Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070910165110.htm), offers great insight:

> Vaginal yeast infections are common; three out of four women have had one at some point during their lives. However, nearly three times out of four, women who are self-diagnosing are treating a problem they don't have.

It's very important that you identify the correct infection. Treating the wrong infection will lead to confusion.

[Susan Hoffstetter](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070910165110.htm), an assistant Professor of Women's Health, offers this insight:

> "If you treat yourself and it never goes away, you shouldn't continue to treat yourself," Hoffstetter said. "You're making a situation worse and you can get into cyclic episodes where you think you have a yeast infection all of the time."



What else could it be? An infection may be Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) or a sexually transmitted disease (STD). 

So here's your big question again: "How do I know if I have a yeast infection?"

If you think you have a yeast infection, you first talk to your doctor. Either in person or on the phone.

In person the doctor will do a test to verify.



**Be like a Doctor**

But what if you want to do a test yourself? 

There are many over-the-counter (OTC) test kits so that you can test for yeast infections at home. A yeast infection test kit can also see other bacterial conditions.

It gets even better.

These test kits are very *easy to use*. 

But wait, there is even more good news.

These test are *quite accurate*. 

A leading provider of test kits, Monistat, claims they are even used by doctors:

![test for yeast infections at home](/images/test-for-yeast-infections-at-home.png)



But let's use some common sense.

If you confirmed with a test that you have a yeast infection, it's time to treat it. Don't wait and pray!

Why have vaginal problems any longer than necessary?



## What Causes Yeast Infections

*Candida albicans* is most likely the fungus in a vaginal yeast infection. Other *Candida* fungi can also produce yeast infections.

The following are yeast infection causes:

- Antibiotic use, which changes your balance of bacteria and fungi
- Diabetes
- Weak immune system
- Birth control or hormone therapies that raise estrogen levels
- Pregnancy
- Stress or lack of sleep
- poor diet with a lot of sugar

Some of these factors correlate. Common sense tells us poor sleep leads to a weaker immune system.



## What does a Yeast Infection look like?

It's time to get graphic. Click below to see a vaginal yeast infection picture.

(Use hidden gallery, like this page https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-does-a-yeast-infection-look-like#Pictures)



![what does a yeast infection look like](/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/1_Site Development/00_Site_Content/2_Articles/yeast-infection-home-remedies/images/what does a yeast infection look like.jpg)

Image credit: [Mikael Häggström, 2014](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Speculum_exam_in_candidal_vulvovaginitis.jpg).

If you didn't see the picture, no problem. I'll describe the yeast infection discharge for you.



**Yeast Infection Discharge**

It's a thick white cottage-cheese like discharge. 

Regular vaginal discharge can also be white and thick. Especially before and after a period.

You can confuse yeast infection discharge with regular vaginal discharge. To tell the difference, ask yourself if you have the other signs of a yeast infection.

If you don't have the signs, then it's likely regular old discharge.

Yeast infection discharge is usually odourless, but not always.



**Do you Smell Beer?**

How does a yeast infection smell like (otherwise)? 

It can be a sweet smell, like honey or cookies. 

Sometime the yeast infection smell is sour. It can smell like beer, bread, or flour.



## Are Yeast Infections Contagious?

The short answer is yes. It is rare though for a yeast infection to spread from person to person.

Let's look at some ways it could spread.



**Sex**

Yes, you can spread a yeast infection through sex.

The Office on Women's Health reports a 15% chance for heterosexuals. Read here for more:

![is yeast infection contagious](/Volumes/GoogleDrive/My Drive/1_Site Development/00_Site_Content/2_Articles/yeast-infection-home-remedies/images/is yeast infection contagious.png)

**Oral Sex**

It can spread from vagina to mouth.

If you have a yeast infection, you need to avoid receiving oral. Your partner giving oral to you could get an oral yeast infection.

Of course, you can still give oral sex. Assuming your partner doesn't have a genital yeast infection.



**Bathing**

This is a very unlikely way for a yeast infection to spread.

That said, it's better that the water is warm, but not hot. *Candida albicans* loves a hot environment.

Be mindful that scented soaps and bubble baths do not help. They may worsen or prolong yeast infections.

So stick with plain mild soap, and keep the water warm. Simple as that.



## Yeast Infection with Sores?

Yes, you can get a vaginal yeast infection with sores. 

This is not a common symptom. If you have vaginal sores, but no yeast infection discharge, it's wise to test for STDs. 

If you have both the yeast infection discharge and sores, it's likely to be a yeast infection.

How does a yeast infection cause sores? 

It's simple. The infection caused a rash, which then causes the sores.

Sores' appearance varies a bit. They may appear as small, red, or flesh-coloured bumps or blisters.



## How to Prevent a Yeast Infection

The best treatment plan is prevention. We all the know the old adage:



> " An ounce of treatment is worth a pound of cure."
>
> ​	- Benjamin Franklin



Here are some useful ways on how to prevent a yeast infection.



**Drink Ivan Chai**

Rolled and fermented fireweed leaves are in Ivan Chai. Fireweed is  an anti-fungal [against 9 different species](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7898123/) of fungus.

Drinking Ivan Chai two to three times daily acts as a preventative remedy. This is especially true during times of stress.

You can [get a trial of Ivan Chai](https://www.trial.ivansherbs.com/vaginal-yeast-infection) from Ivan's Herbs. You'll likely enjoy the natural sweet taste too.



**Cut down the Stress **

It's common sense, and it's proven by studies. Reduce stress levels and yeast infections occur less often.

A well regarded journal of women's health published a concrete finding. Women with higher perceived stress were [more likely to have recurring yeast infections](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01674820601168176).

So get enough sleep and exercise. Your immune system will improve and better fight yeast infections.



**Don't Douche It**

The vagina is a self-cleaning system. Don't douche it.

Don't use scented hygiene products that change the balance of bacteria. That means don't use scented soaps, tampons, sprays, pads, etc. 



**Make Friends with Good Bacteria**

What you are after here are the live cultures. 

That friendly bacteria named *Lactobacillus acidophilus*. Let's call him Lacto. 

You want to replenish all the good bacteria you can.

This is especially true after taking antibiotics. Be friends with Lacto, and he'll take care of you.

That means get a dose or two of Lacto everyday. Here's a quick list:

- Natural yogurt
- Kimchi
- Kefir
- Sauerkraut
- Probiotic supplement



**Stay Dry and Loose**

*Candida* *albicans* overgrowth happens when it get hot and wet. You want stay dry to fight it off.

Here are a few pointers:

- Cotton underwear that breathes well.
- Sleeping without underwear.
- Getting out of wet swimsuits as soon as possible.
- Loose fitting clothes.
- Change tampons often.

It's a small lifestyle change. But what's your health worth?

A lot.



## How Long does a Yeast Infection Last?

How long a yeast infection lasts depends on two factors: How it's treated and how severe it is.

Moderate to severe infections may take one to two weeks to go away.

A mild yeast infection can go away in as few as three days. 



**Will a yeast infection go away on its own?**

Yes, sometimes they don't need treatment. That's rare though.

It's best that you treat it though. Why risk more pain and complications?



**Home Remedies**

For a mild yeast infection, home remedies are effective. 

For more severe infections, you could delay relief if you use these milder home remedies.



**Over-the-counter (OTC) Drugs **

For mild infections, OTC options may be your best bet. There are usually in 3 or 7 day doses.

They come in many forms, such as:

- creams
- tablets
- ointments
- suppositories

These drugs may cause burning and irritation when applied. 

Oil-based creams and ointments also weaken silicone and latex. Make it a point to have another method of birth control as your back-up.



**Prescription Drugs**

These are your heavy guns. These are appropriate for severe yeast infections.

They often come in 7 or 14 day doses. Some are single day dose.

The same forms apply here. Creams, tablets, ointments, or suppositories.

Like oil-based OTC drugs, get a back up birth-control. The oil weakens latex and silicone in condoms and diaphragms.



**Conclusion**

Treating a yeast infection is a must. Don't think you're one of the lucky ones and that the yeast infection will go away on its own.

Stay on the safe side and call your doctor once you think you have a yeast infection. Let them know how you plan to treat it.

If signs of yeast infection are still there after one to two weeks, call your doctor again.

For recurring yeast infections remember to stay dry. Get natural anti-fungals in your system like Ivan Chai and *Lactobacillus acidophilus*.

For recurring yeast infections, a more serious pharmaceutical drug is worth investigating.

Stay true to the tips in this article and I guarantee you'll be in a better position to fight yeast infections.
